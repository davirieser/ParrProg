If we execute the gprof profiler we get a detailed explanation of the times the programm spends in what functions. (See Ex02 for the files generated by the profiler and the makefile to generate those)
There we can see the time it spends in the function itself and what it spends in functions that get called from it respectively.
We can also see how many times a function gets called.
If one wants to improve the performance of a program it would be important to understand where one profit the most from improvements.
Therefore the analysis.txt provides valuable information on where to start with the improvements.
