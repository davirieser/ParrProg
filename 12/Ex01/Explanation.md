## Exmplanation strength reduction

### a
Here a does the same as the solution:
 - Storing the value of the edi register in the esi register
 - Shifting the esi register 5 bits to the left to multiply it by 32

### b
Here b does the same as the solution:
 - Storing the value of the edi register in the esi register
 - Shifting the esi register 4 bits to the left to multiply it by 16
 - Subtracting the esi register from the edi register to multiply it by 15

### c
The base code and the solution are diffrent.
The solution does the following:
   - Both store the value of the edi register in the esi register
