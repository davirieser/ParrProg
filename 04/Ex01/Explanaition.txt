We have the following values for OMP_PROC_BIND:

    false: No binding (default)
    true: Bind all threads to a set of hardware resources
    spread: Spread threads evenly across all available hardware resources
    close: Bind threads to nearby hardware resources
    master: Bind only the master thread to a set of hardware resources
    explicit: Allow the program to explicitly set the binding of threads using OMP_PLACES
        explicit was not working properly

The possible values for OMP_PLACES are:

    threads: Each thread is assigned its own set of hardware resources (default)
    cores: Each core is assigned its own set of hardware resources
    sockets: Each socket is assigned its own set of hardware resources
    numa: Each NUMA node is assigned its own set of hardware resources
        numa was not working properly

All except "master" seem to run fast, even equally fast, but master somehow takes 4 times the time.
