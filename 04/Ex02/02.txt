- flush.c creates 2 Threads
	- Thread 1 is the Write Thread
	- Thread 2 is the Read Thread
	- Write Thread writes to the data-Buffer and sets the Written-Flag
	- The Read Thread waits for the Written-Flag to be set and then prints the data to Stdout

- When the Code is compiled and run, some of the Time the Program enters an endless Loop.
	- This is because the flag is cached by the Read-Thread as false and never invalidated.
	- Theoretically sometimes the data should be printed as a random Value but we couldn't observe this yet.

- Where to put Flush Directives?
	-> See flush.c
