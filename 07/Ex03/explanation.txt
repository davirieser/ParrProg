What can you observe? 
	The Program is 4 Times as fast.

Is the result still correct?
	Yes (after using the correct Loop Variable Increment).

Perf Findings:
- 1,000,000,058 PACKED_SINGLE Events
- 1,000,009,230 Total Events
	(The Difference is probably due to the setup and Loop Variable Increments).

How does the solution for this Exercise compare to Exercise 2 and Exercise 1? 
	It is faster because it only runs 1,000,000,000 PACKED_SINGLE Instructions
	instead of the 1,500,000,000 run by Exercise 1 and Exercise 2.

Are there any advantages or disadvantages?
	- Advantages:
		- The Program is faster.
		- All Instructions could be vectorized.
	- Disadvantages:
		- The Code is harder to read because of the Intrinsic Function Calls. 
		- The Code is longer because the Vectorized Registers cannot be used like normal floats.
		- The Code is more complex because of the non-unit Loop Variable Increment.
