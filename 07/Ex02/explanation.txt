What can you observe? 
	Auto-Vectorization and OpenMP are nearly identical in Performance.

Is the result still correct?
	Yes.

Perf Findings:
	-   500,000,057 PACKED_SINGLE Events(Add + Mul)
	- 1,000,002,159 VECTOR Events		(Store + Load) => One of them is probably not being vectorized)
	- 1,500,009,227 Total Events

double => float Findings:
	Time (double)	= 1.637 s
	Time (float)	= 0.865 s

	Optimisation is the same, but since double is twice as big as float, only half as many Values can be calculated using a single vectorized Instruction.

	- Perf:
		- 1,000,000,000 PACKED_DOUBLE Events (Add + Mul)
		- 2,000,000,153 VECTOR Events		 (Store + Load) => One of them is probably not being vectorized)
		- 3,000,007,227 Total Events

How does the solution for this Exercise compare to Exercise 1? 
	Auto-Vectorization and OpenMP are nearly identical in Performance.

Are there any advantages or disadvantages?
	- Advantages:
		- Better because you don't need Compiler Flags and you know which Loops are vectorized.
	- Disadvantages:
		- None that we found.
